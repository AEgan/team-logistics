Team Logistics
==============

This is my final project for CMU 67-328.
It is an implementation of a sports team ride coordination application in nodejs and expressjs using mongodb.

To run this application, make sure you have node and mongo installed correctly.
After cloning, run 
```
npm install
```
Then navigate to where you have mongodb, and inside the bin folder run
```
./mongod
```

finally, in the project directory run
```
node app.js
```

This project uses the node module googlemaps, which can be found here:
https://github.com/moshen/node-googlemaps

and async, which can be found here
https://github.com/caolan/async

This project is currently in development, and there are many known issues that will be addressed in the next few days. I will update this README with a list of known issues that have not been fixed by the time the project is due, and may go back to fix them at a later date.

This scope of this project is significantly larger than it had to be, and was originally designed the way an implementation in rails would be designed.
I may go back and do this with rails, and if I do I will link the github repo.
